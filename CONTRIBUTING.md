# How to contribute

I would like to encourage you to contribute to the repository.
This should be as easy as possible for you but there are a few things to consider when contributing.
The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you want to submit a pull request.

## How to prepare

* You need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit an [Assembly Bounty](https://assembly.com/mana/bounties) for your issue if there is not one yet.
	* Describe the issue and include steps to reproduce if it's a bug.
	* Ensure to mention the earliest version that you know is affected.
* If you are able and want to fix this, fork the repository on GitHub

## Make Changes

* In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming patch and name it `ASM-[bounty number]` where `[bounty number]` is the bounty id of the related assembly bounty.
	* Usually this is based on the `master` branch.
	
	```
	git checkout master
	git checkout -b ASM-[bounty number]
	```
	 
	* Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make sure you stick to the coding style that is used already.
* Squash your topic branch on `master` in as few logical commits as possible.
   
   ```
   git rebase -i master
   ```

* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Be sure to submit relevant tests to your patch / new feature so it can be tested easily.
* Assure nothing is broken by running all the tests.

## Submit Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Open a pull request to the original repository and choose the right original branch you want to patch.
	_Advanced users may install the `hub` gem and use the [`hub pull-request` command](https://github.com/defunkt/hub#git-pull-request)._
* If not done in commit messages (which you really should do) please reference and update your issue with the code changes. But _please do not close the issue yourself_.
* Even if you have write access to the repository, do not directly push or merge pull-requests. Let another team member review your pull request and approve.
* If you have the authority to merge your a pull request ensure it passed the build test with Travis CI before merging the request.
