## v0.1.0-prealpha.1.0.0
This product is currently in an alpha development state and is not yet ready for production use. Please note that the semver file reflects the api version and not the application version.

### Mana
There are a lot of great invoicing, project management, and team collaboration tools on the market today. The problem is all three of those things are usually handled in two to three different tools. What if one piece of software could effectively manage all aspects of project management, accounting, team management, client management, and sales force management? Mana plans to bring all those small pieces into one easy to use application that every employee in any role within a team will enjoy.
